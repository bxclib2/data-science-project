    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm to compute the isochrone map could be slow due to the exponential nature of the recursive algorithm upon it was built.\n",

    "**Possible improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment we only take into account, for walking, stations in a radius of 100 meters from the arrival point, it's possible to improve this by putting no-limits in the distance we can walk and optimize over it.\n",
    "The current used PDF (the gamma function) is a first guess, it can be improved with different models, for example, a Poisson distribution.\n",
