We can see that the results are overall promising: Because of the confidence level we are missing some of the stations present on the west side of the centre of Zurich, that maybe because to travel in the city center implies taking buses that are statistical more prone to have delays and hence get excluded from our reachable stations. At the same time we can see that the furthest stations are equally reached, that's because they are probably connected by trains that statistically have less delays. The representation we obtained from the determistic isochrone map is a sparse representation of the reachable stations, that means that it only put in evidence a small area around the stations reached, such representation is more similar to the heat-map we computed instead of the convex hull. In this example we can observe that our algorithm computes a whole set of reachable stations along the east cost of the lake while the deterministic one only finds two. The two stops found by the determistic isochrone map are quite far from the south-east side of the lake and the absence of all the intermediate stations found by us may be because the algoritm that run in background of the web-site (to which we don't have access) is computing only the furthest reachable station without the intermediate stops."
